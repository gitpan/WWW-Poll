WWW::Poll, version 0.01

STATUS
======
This is ALPHA right now. 

Comments, bug reports, etc. are appreciated.

DESCRIPTION
===========
This module is a simple perl module to allow folks to easily run those oh, so popular polls one sees nowadays.  It requires only that you create a world-writable (or server-writable) directory called "data" with a few files to seed the poll.  I also have a couple of example files included (poll.pl & poll_admin.pl).  If you run the script and get an error just run poll_admin.pl first to get it going.  

I'll be ironing out as much of this as I can.  I hope to have IPs logged in the future to prevent redundant votes.    

INSTALLATION
============

After unpacking the tar file, do the usual:

        perl Makefile.PL 
        make
        make test 
        make install

There is embedded POD documentation in Poll.pm with description on how to use. 

There are example scripts located within the demo/ directory of this distribution. It contains most files needed to get a web-based poll up and running.
